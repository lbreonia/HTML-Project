# HTML-Project
This is my programming project that I completed in CSCI120. The purpose of the project was to build a personal website with the HTML coding, which we learned over the semester. This was my first time coding anything, I did not have any previous experience. I used Notepad++ to complete this project and uploaded the website to the server through FileZilla.
